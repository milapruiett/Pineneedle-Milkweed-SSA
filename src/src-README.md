## Coding files
This contains the main coding document that we use, which is called main.R. Running it installs the relevant libraries, queries data on the Pineneedle Milkweed from gbif, creates a csv. file and produces a Species Occurence Map and a Species Distribution Model.

The pineneedle-sdm-single.R contains the specific code to make a Species Distribution Model, from Jeff Oliver.
The sdm-functions.R and the setup.R are files complementing this process, also from Jeff Oliver.
